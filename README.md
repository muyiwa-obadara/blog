This is a blog application guided by Anthonio Mele. The project spans through Chapter one to Three of the book "Django 4 by Example".

I have written my own custom CSS and used a little Bootstrap. I strongly recommend this book for passionate software engineers like me.

This projects covers the following parts of Django:
- Models
- Model Managers
- Templates
- Views (Function and Class based)
- Custom Template Tags
- Custom Template Filters
- Admin Models Registrations
- Admin Site Management
- Sitemaps
- RSS Feed
- PostgreSQL (Switching Databases and transferring data)
- Sending Emails
- Forms
